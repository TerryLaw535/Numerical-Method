# Numerical-Method

These are the courseworks of MATH2019 *Introduction to Scientific Computation* in University of Nottingham, some of them are very useful numerical methods that can be used to solve many problems. My average marks of these courseworks are 38/40. There may be some mistakes in codes and commands.
